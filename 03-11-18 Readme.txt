-Changed hierarchy by moving sprites to their designated folder in prefabs folder

-Fixed the prefabs 

-added the new version of test map with the prefabs for demonstration purpoces

*Merging of the characterstatus and the playerstatus seems really annoying so ill leave it
to people who know how to merge -> remember the scripts like healthupdate still reference
characterupdate so merging the script needs some changes to code*
